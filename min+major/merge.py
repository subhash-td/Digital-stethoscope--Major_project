# This script merges two or more python files into one

# It also assumes that the functions have unique names within each file, but they may have duplicates across files
# It uses a prefix for the functions based on the file name
# It handles different types of import statements and only replaces the imports if there is a matching python file to be merged
# It also checks if the merged file is runnable and reports any errors or warnings
